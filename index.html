	<h3>A little bit about me</h3>
	<p>I work at the habit burger grill, which is where I have spent the majority of my time. I go to a programming class at mtech where I learn how to do dope stuff like program websites. I really want the next one I make to look better than this one, and I'm confident that it will.</p>
